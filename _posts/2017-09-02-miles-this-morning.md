**10 miles** this morning for my scheduled long run. I got out much later (8am) than planned because I watched the live stream of the first group of finishers at UTMB. The temperature was higher than ideal so part of the run was a slog. Tried a new gel today: the Honey Stinger Fruit Smoothie was pretty good and sat well in my stomach.
