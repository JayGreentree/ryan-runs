**5 miles** today, as per my training plan. It's hard to get motivated for 5 miles at 6 AM in the dark. But this is a goal that requires completing each small step along the way. One thing that helps me get out the door at 6 AM is to set out my gear the night before. I fill up my bottle, set out my shoes, shorts, shirt, socks, hat, headlamp (it's really dark in some spots), and headphones. I have a system for getting geared up and go through the motions and then I'm out the back door a few minutes later.
