Ordered a 24 count box of the [Honey Stinger Fruit Smoothie gels I tried a couple weeks ago](http://www.ryanruns.com/2017/09/02/miles-this-morning.html). Amazon had the best price per ounce so I went with them. These gels don't have caffeine so they'll be my main fuel with caffeinated ones as a follow up.
