Today was my first run using the built-in Apple Workout app on my Apple Watch. For more than a year I’ve used Strava on my phone and watch. I switched for two reasons: the Strava app is buggy, and the Workout app gives you stop/pause access via the Digital Crown and the other button (whatever it’s called). If you’ve ever tried to use your Apple Watch with wet or sweaty hands than you know why this matters.
