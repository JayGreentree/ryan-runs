Yesterday's long run was my first run with the Apple Watch Series 3 GPS + LTE, Nike+ edition. I've been running with my Series 0 Apple Watch since 2015 but I always carried my phone with me. I have a giant iPhone 6s Plus and it's annoying to carry, even using the SPIBelt. 

The previous watches were a step better with built-in GPS but sometimes I am gone running for 1-3 hours at a time and I like to be able to get in touch with family if I need help. Up until Thursday, when Apple released the Series 3 Nike+ version, I would always need to carry my phone so I had a way to contact someone.

With the GPS + LTE option on the Series 3 watches, I can finally ditch my phone. 

But it's not perfect.

My run yesterday took 3 hours total and during that time I had the following enabled or turned on:

* LTE
* Workout app running (tracking my run)
* Heart rate sensor
* Bluetooth enabled with headphones connected
* Music playing (saved to device)

Basically, all of the default settings. I _did not_ have the Workout Power Saving Mode enabled.

I glanced at my watch every mile or two, let's say. Not too often. The screen was mostly unused over the three hours.

The result? At the end of my run I had 33% battery remaining. Not perfect but still pretty good considering what the watch is doing during that time.

(If I was a sub-3 marathoner (not even close) this might be enough. But I'm not, and it's not.)

For my runs that go longer than 3 hours I'll likely use the Workout Power Saving Mode, which turns off the celluar connection and heart rate sensor. No one will be able to reach _me_ but I will be able to easily enable LTE and call or text someone if I need help.
