My leg issues are persisting. After an easy 3 mile run on Thursday, my legs felt like I ran 5x that. It was more than soreness and stiffness. It was actual pain in both legs.

I've been pushing through some discomfort but it shouldn't feel like this. It's affecting my gait when I walk and for the first few miles of my runs.

I'm going to rest. I don't know anything beyond that at this point.
