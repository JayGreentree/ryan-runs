        <description>&lt;p&gt;Took nighttime cold medicine last night and then stayed awake to see what it felt like when it kicked in. Don‚Äôt do that! &lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Marathon Wrap-up</title>
        
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I am wrapping up this version of my microblog with a recap of the culmination of months of training: completing my first marathon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-weather&quot;&gt;The Weather&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Overcast but warm. Much warmer than I had anticipated. I showed up at the start in a light racing jacket so I stayed warm but really didn‚Äôt need it.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Last year it poured for 5 miles of my half marathon. I was soaked &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; cold because of colder temperatures. This year it poured for a couple of miles but it was humid and warm (6os).&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;It got much warmer as the morning went on. The sun came out, which wasn‚Äôt in the forecast.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I trained in Austin, Texas Summer and Fall weather. I‚Äôm very accustomed to the heat and running in it. But I let my guard down.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-i-did-wrong&quot;&gt;What I Did Wrong&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I didn‚Äôt hydrate enough in the first 12 miles of the race. I met up with my wife and daughter around mid-race and realized my water bottle was still too full and my Gatorade Endurance bottle was also too full. I should‚Äôve completely depleted both by mile 12.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I trusted the weather forecast and didn‚Äôt change plans once on the course. &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I became dehydrated mid-race and at mile 14 my calf muscles started cramping. I went from running to that weird hoppity hop like I was stepping on hot coals.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I didn‚Äôt rehydrate fast enough (I don‚Äôt know if I could), which meant more walking than I really should‚Äôve done.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-i-did-right&quot;&gt;What I Did Right&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I started the race slow and easy. I didn‚Äôt worry too much about whether I could finish (barring injury or illness) because I would bring it home even if I had to fight hard (Narrator: And, oh, how he did).&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;No lost toenails, no foot issues, no blisters, no chafing. My work on properly lubing and using only gear I was experienced with really paid off. I had a rough day but it could‚Äôve been worse with these completely preventable issues.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I trained with the course drink (Gatorade Endurance) because I wanted to be prepared to have to consume it without any worry about stomach problems. This turned out to be a really, really smart move.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I carried two soft Ultimate Direction water bottles. One had water, one had the Gatorade Endurance. The plan was to fill up the Gatorade one at every available aid station and hand off the water one after the first half marathon when I saw my support team (my wife and daughter).&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I also trained using the same gels for almost the entirety of my training schedule. This also meant I could down gels without worrying about stomach issues.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I kept a cool head when things started to go wrong. Once I hydrated more my thoughts became even more lucid and rational. I attribute this to having hit rough spots during my training and knowing that hydration is the linchpin of this entire thing.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;final-thoughts&quot;&gt;Final Thoughts&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I‚Äôm proud of my overall performance because I met my goal of finishing.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I‚Äôm proud that I kept cool under enormous personal pressure. I‚Äôve trained for this race since August, thought about it since winter, and it became a huge goal for me.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I met a group of guys who all worked together to finish the race. I‚Äôm very insular and a loner when it comes to running. This was a nice change (even if it was mostly out of necessity).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Will a run a marathon again?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yes. I want to improve in the areas where I messed up. I‚Äôll be back at it.&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;I mismanaged the first 12 miles of fluid intake and it caught up with me. The weather was warmer than expected and I lost track of my hydration. Around mile 14 I had cramping and slowed down to focus on getting as much salty fluids (Gatorade Endurance) in me. &lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;I will run in the Saucony Guide ISOs on Sunday. Much of my training was done in Mizunos, which ended up injuring me. Switched back to Saucony in late October. &lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4 miles&lt;/strong&gt; which is part of the taper, I guess? Legs feel great and it was almost exactly the weather forecasted for next weekend‚Äôs marathon. &lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;I‚Äôve been resting my legs for the last week+. Whatever I did has lingered but my legs do feel better. At this point my training plan is out the window and I need to rethink it. &lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;My leg issues are persisting. After an easy 3 mile run on Thursday, my legs felt like I ran 5x that. It was more than soreness and stiffness. It was actual pain in both legs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I‚Äôve been pushing through some discomfort but it shouldn‚Äôt feel like this. It‚Äôs affecting my gait when I walk and for the first few miles of my runs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I‚Äôm going to rest. I don‚Äôt know anything beyond that at this point.&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;Just shy of &lt;strong&gt;11 miles&lt;/strong&gt; in beautiful, chilly, and rainy Portland, OR. I‚Äôm in town for work (teaching tomorrow). I ran along the waterfront, which was a nice change. No photos because I forgot my GoPro  and don‚Äôt carry my iPhone anymore now that I have a Series 3 Apple Watch.&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;Considering ordering a pair of the Saucony Guide 10s (my current pair are the 9s) to replace the Mizunos. I‚Äôm not really into collecting shoes but I need to kick the Mizunos to the curb. They don‚Äôt work for me.&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3 miles&lt;/strong&gt; in a glorious 49F. Switched back to my Sauconys after a couple of months running in the Mizunos. It‚Äôs notable how lightweight the Sauconys are. I did this because I suspect the shoes are causing some of my leg issues. &lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;10 miles&lt;/strong&gt; of a planned 16. I‚Äôm extremely disappointed I wasn‚Äôt able to complete the full run. I‚Äôve been dealing with hamstring pain in my left leg and today it flared up at mile 5 and started radiating up to my lower back and down to my heel. More soon. &lt;/p&gt;

        <title>3 Hour Run with Series 3 Nike+ Apple Watch (with LTE)</title>
        
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Yesterday‚Äôs long run was my first run with the Apple Watch Series 3 GPS + LTE, Nike+ edition. I‚Äôve been running with my Series 0 Apple Watch since 2015 but I always carried my phone with me. I have a giant iPhone 6s Plus and it‚Äôs annoying to carry, even using the SPIBelt. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The previous watches were a step better with built-in GPS but sometimes I am gone running for 1-3 hours at a time and I like to be able to get in touch with family if I need help. Up until Thursday, when Apple released the Series 3 Nike+ version, I would always need to carry my phone so I had a way to contact someone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With the GPS + LTE option on the Series 3 watches, I can finally ditch my phone. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But it‚Äôs not perfect.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My run yesterday took 3 hours total and during that time I had the following enabled or turned on:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;LTE&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Workout app running (tracking my run)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Heart rate sensor&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Bluetooth enabled with headphones connected&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Music playing (saved to device)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Basically, all of the default settings. I &lt;em&gt;did not&lt;/em&gt; have the Workout Power Saving Mode enabled.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I glanced at my watch every mile or two, let‚Äôs say. Not too often. The screen was mostly unused over the three hours.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The result? At the end of my run I had 33% battery remaining. Not perfect but still pretty good considering what the watch is doing during that time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(If I was a sub-3 marathoner (not even close) this might be enough. But I‚Äôm not, and it‚Äôs not.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For my runs that go longer than 3 hours I‚Äôll likely use the Workout Power Saving Mode, which turns off the celluar connection and heart rate sensor. No one will be able to reach &lt;em&gt;me&lt;/em&gt; but I will be able to easily enable LTE and call or text someone if I need help.&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;15 miles&lt;/strong&gt; for the long run today. This marks my longest run ever (previously 13.1), which is a major accomplishment for me but still not the ultimate goal. Today‚Äôs run started in the dark with a headlamp and ended with sunglasses in the sunshine. Also: ouch. &lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4 miles&lt;/strong&gt; this morning out of a planned 7 miles. I‚Äôve been dealing with sore legs (beyond normal soreness) and a slightly aggravated left hamstring. I‚Äôm trying to keep building miles while staying healthy. Tomorrow I‚Äôll do 3 more miles to get my 7 and keep moving up in miles.&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;My new Apple Watch Nike edition shipped and should be here on Thursday. I‚Äôm looking forward to trying out the new cellular capability on my weekend long run. I hope I‚Äôll never have to take my phone again. &lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3 miles&lt;/strong&gt; this morning. The first run of the week is always a little rough in the beginning as I get loose again. We are back to warmer temps in the morning. It‚Äôs fine for 3 miles but tomorrow is 8. &lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;10 miles&lt;/strong&gt; today in a step-back for the long run. I ran after sunrise but it was in the 60s so it felt good. When it‚Äôs cooler I definitely drink more water than Gatorade Endurance. It‚Äôs Fall but Austin still plans to bring the heat next week. &lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Using Workout App Instead of Strava</title>
        
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Today was my first run using the built-in Apple Workout app on my Apple Watch. For more than a year I‚Äôve used Strava on my phone and watch. I switched for two reasons: the Strava app is buggy, and the Workout app gives you stop/pause access via the Digital Crown and the other button (whatever it‚Äôs called). If you‚Äôve ever tried to use your Apple Watch with wet or sweaty hands than you know why this matters. &lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;13.1 miles&lt;/strong&gt; or exactly a half marathon for this week‚Äôs long run. I guess that means I‚Äôm almost halfway through my training. I got a later start (8am) so th temps weren‚Äôt on my side. This made for a tougher run and one time where I had to pull back because I was overheated. &lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;Today is a (much needed) rest day. My only planned physical activity is my daily walk to my office. Strava shows 12 miles for the week, with another 13 planned for tomorrow‚Äôs long run. That‚Äôd be my biggest total miles logged in a single week. My legs definitely feel it.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Honey Stinger Fruit Smoothie Gels</title>
        
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Ordered a 24 count box of the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ryanruns.com/2017/09/02/miles-this-morning.html&quot;&gt;Honey Stinger Fruit Smoothie gels I tried a couple weeks ago&lt;/a&gt;. Amazon had the best price per ounce so I went with them. These gels don‚Äôt have caffeine so they‚Äôll be my main fuel with caffeinated ones as a follow up.&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;I‚Äôm feeling the wear on my legs. Just generally tired and aching. As I get close the halfway point of the training schedule, I think my legs are hitting normal capacity and now working to get stronger. &lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;6 miles&lt;/strong&gt; this morning for the longer of my 3 weekday runs. I got an earlier start (shortly before 6) than usual because I was awake anyway. It‚Äôs hot again here in Austin. At 6 AM the temperature was 77 degrees. That makes for a tough run, even in the dark.&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;A popular anti-chafe salve in the trail running community is &lt;a href=&quot;[squirrels](http://squirrels) it utter.com&quot;&gt;Squirrel‚Äôs Nut Butter&lt;/a&gt;. That‚Äôs how I found out about it. I picked up a tin to try for long runs. It‚Äôs greasy, unlike Body Glide, but does a nice job on spots that Body Glide doesn‚Äôt.&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;12 miles&lt;/strong&gt; for the long run today. I saw that that temps were not going to get very low so I decided to get up early (for a weekend) and start at 6 AM. Running in the dark but cloud cover after sunrise meant the 75 degree temp was tolerable.&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3 miles&lt;/strong&gt; today in Cedar Rapids, Iowa. I ran on the Cedar River trail in the early morning sun and fog. Really nice run. Despite temps in the 50s I managed to work up a sweat. I was supposed to run 6 today but traveling required me to alter that. &lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;Today is a cross training day. I‚Äôve never been very good about cross training days in the past (unless a nap counts) but today I did a couple miles hike at Wild Basin Nature Reserve with my family. Not too strenuous or long but just enough to loosen up my legs.&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;7 mile&lt;/strong&gt; long run today. It‚Äôs a step-back week so nothing too challenging but next weekend is back at the higher mileage. High 60s and breezy this morning. Got out late so I had to deal with sun being higher in the sky. Good thing I was sporting my new pair of Goodr sunglasses.&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3 miles&lt;/strong&gt; on really nice 59 degree morning. First cool morning run here in Austin since early Spring. I have a little discomfort in my left hamstring so I‚Äôm going to rest up before my Saturday long run. This week is a step back week in my training plan; my long run is only 7 miles. &lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;5 miles&lt;/strong&gt; today, as per my training plan. It‚Äôs hard to get motivated for 5 miles at 6 AM in the dark. But this is a goal that requires completing each small step along the way. One thing that helps me get out the door at 6 AM is to set out my gear the night before. I fill up my bottle, set out my shoes, shorts, shirt, socks, hat, headlamp (it‚Äôs really dark in some spots), and headphones. I have a system for getting geared up and go through the motions and then I‚Äôm out the back door a few minutes later.&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3 miles&lt;/strong&gt; today. My first run since Saturday‚Äôs long run. The start was a little clunky as I got my legs but felt good about a mile in. I pushed the pace a little to see how it felt. Not bad!&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;And the Strava app on my Apple Watch crapped out at mile 8, missing two miles of running. This is probably why most runners use a dedicated watch, not a Apple Watch. &lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;10 miles&lt;/strong&gt; this morning for my scheduled long run. I got out much later (8am) than planned because I watched the live stream of the first group of finishers at UTMB. The temperature was higher than ideal so part of the run was a slog. Tried a new gel today: the Honey Stinger Fruit Smoothie was pretty good and sat well in my stomach. &lt;/p&gt;
