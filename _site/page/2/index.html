I’ve been dealing with hamstring pain in my left leg and today it flared up at mile 5 and started radiating up to my lower back and down to my heel. More soon. </p>

      <div class="e-content"><p>Yesterday’s long run was my first run with the Apple Watch Series 3 GPS + LTE, Nike+ edition. I’ve been running with my Series 0 Apple Watch since 2015 but I always carried my phone with me. I have a giant iPhone 6s Plus and it’s annoying to carry, even using the SPIBelt. </p>

<p>The previous watches were a step better with built-in GPS but sometimes I am gone running for 1-3 hours at a time and I like to be able to get in touch with family if I need help. Up until Thursday, when Apple released the Series 3 Nike+ version, I would always need to carry my phone so I had a way to contact someone.</p>

<p>With the GPS + LTE option on the Series 3 watches, I can finally ditch my phone. </p>

<p>But it’s not perfect.</p>

<p>My run yesterday took 3 hours total and during that time I had the following enabled or turned on:</p>

<ul>
  <li>LTE</li>
  <li>Workout app running (tracking my run)</li>
  <li>Heart rate sensor</li>
  <li>Bluetooth enabled with headphones connected</li>
  <li>Music playing (saved to device)</li>
</ul>

<p>Basically, all of the default settings. I <em>did not</em> have the Workout Power Saving Mode enabled.</p>

<p>I glanced at my watch every mile or two, let’s say. Not too often. The screen was mostly unused over the three hours.</p>

<p>The result? At the end of my run I had 33% battery remaining. Not perfect but still pretty good considering what the watch is doing during that time.</p>

<p>(If I was a sub-3 marathoner (not even close) this might be enough. But I’m not, and it’s not.)</p>

<p>For my runs that go longer than 3 hours I’ll likely use the Workout Power Saving Mode, which turns off the celluar connection and heart rate sensor. No one will be able to reach <em>me</em> but I will be able to easily enable LTE and call or text someone if I need help.</p>

If you’ve ever tried to use your Apple Watch with wet or sweaty hands than you know why this matters. </p>
