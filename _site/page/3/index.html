High 60s and breezy this morning. Got out late so I had to deal with sun being higher in the sky. Good thing I was sporting my new pair of Goodr sunglasses.</p>

      <div class="e-content"><p><strong>5 miles</strong> today, as per my training plan. It’s hard to get motivated for 5 miles at 6 AM in the dark. But this is a goal that requires completing each small step along the way. One thing that helps me get out the door at 6 AM is to set out my gear the night before. I fill up my bottle, set out my shoes, shorts, shirt, socks, hat, headlamp (it’s really dark in some spots), and headphones. I have a system for getting geared up and go through the motions and then I’m out the back door a few minutes later.</p>

I got out much later (8am) than planned because I watched the live stream of the first group of finishers at UTMB. The temperature was higher than ideal so part of the run was a slog. Tried a new gel today: the Honey Stinger Fruit Smoothie was pretty good and sat well in my stomach. </p>
